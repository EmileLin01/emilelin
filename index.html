									<h2>EV-Drive: An Open API Specification Project</h2>
									<p>I wrote a YAML file to describe the API of a fictional electric car dealership. Documented endpoints include how to browse the inventory based on
									certain parameters and how to make (and delete) an online order.</p>
									<p>I've been learning about API documentation in my spare time for the past few months. This project is simply a culmination of my learnings. Drop in again in a few months to see 
									what I've picked up next.</p>

										<h2>Online Help Guide: Nectari</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/nectari.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As part of an interview assessment for Nectari Software Inc., I've created an online help system using ClickHelp (trial version) to describe, explain, and organize their new 
									"Formula Wizard" feature. The assessment is linked below in ClickHelp's ReaderUX format (i.e., out-of-the-box CSS).</p>
									<p>An offer was made but was rejected.</p>

										<h2>Homebrew<br />
										D&D Items</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/items.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I created a compendium of homebrew D&D weapons, armours, and other wondrous items based on the equipment of my favourite League of Legends characters. I wrote a flavour
									text for each entry as well as their 5e-based gameplay mechanics.</p>
									<p>By sharing this project with you, I attempt to showcase my copywriting, technical writing, and LaTeX skills.</p>

										<h2>A Mock<br />
										Data Integration Guide</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/prophix.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I wrote this guide in 2021 as part of my application for the technical writer position at Prophix Software Ltd. The content is based on a 20-minute conversation with two engineers, so it's far from
									specific and comprehensive.</p>
									<p>This work shows my ability to understand technical concepts with minimal consultation, organize them in a logical fashion, and explain them succinctly. Oh, and everything is coded via LaTeX from scratch.</p>

										<h2>Competitive Pokemon<br />
										Analyses</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/pokemon.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I used Asciidoctor to generate an HTML5 page containing a bunch of Pokemon analyses (which I wrote, of course). I also downloaded the Asciidoctor stylesheet 
									and changed some of the CSS to make the content more presentable.</p>
									<p>Having self-learned Asciidoctor as a documentation tool, I wanted to show you that I can do moderately cool things with it.</p>

										<h2>Solar Energy in <br />
										Mozambique</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/solar.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>CPCS, a global infrastructure consulting firm, found a way around Mozambique's energy deficiency, which is to store solar energy in batteries. Eager to share its solution with the world, CPCS hired me to ghostwrite <a href="https://cpcs.ca/pairing-solar-energy-with-battery-storage-in-mozambique/" target="_blank"><u>a thought leadership article</u></a> detailing its energy procurement strategy. The 
									article was later picked up by Energy Global, a leading magazine in electrical engineering, receiving wide readership.</p>
									<p>This article speaks to my ability to ask the right questions to experts and to repackage their answers into a story that appeals to a broad audience.</p>

										Jarvan ADC?!</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/Jarvan_image.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I wrote a guide (incomplete) on how to play as Jarvan ADC in League of Legends. If these words don't ring any bells to you, that's okay. Download the guide anyway and check out
									my presentation skills in Adobe Xd.</p>

										<h2>After the Pivot â€” <br />
										Now What?</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit" style="pointer-events: none; cursor: default"><img src="images/pivot.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I wrote this essay in 2015 in partial completion of my Master's degree. The work was subsequently published by the Journal of Military and Strategic Studies and was awarded the <a href="https://jmss.org/article/view/58162" target="_blank"><u>best essay in the volume</u></a>.</p>
									<p>This achievement is included here as a testament to my ability to research and digest complex sources, form a unique position based on the literature, and persuasively defend it in a clear and elegant manner.</p>
